## Ease of visualizing history

### Problem
It's a bit hard for me to visualize changes. It'll be really hard for nontechnical people to get used to changes in PRs.

## Voting

### Problem
It's really hard to vote for issues. It's impossible to vote for solutions (there is no proposal feature)

### Related feature: Proposals
With each issue, we should link to a proposal doc of some sort. For example, Issue #1 should have a list of docs for proposals...not just a list of comments.

## Proposal of solutions

See above

## Issue reprioritization

### Problem
Related to voting and proposals. Once there's an issue, it remains in order of creation. We should automatically change the priority of issues.
